Various issues,"Hello,
Thank you for your feedback and for supporting our project. We are thrilled to hear that you received your jacket and we appreciate your honest opinion. We are sorry to hear that you are not completely satisfied with the jacket and we would like to address some of the issues you raised.
The pockets are not sewn all the way at the front of the jacket on purpose. This is to avoid adding bulk to the front hem of the jacket or interfering with the waterproofing. We only used a small point of sewing to keep them in place and prevent them from flapping around. This is a design feature that we think enhances the functionality and aesthetics of the jacket.
The elastic loops for the hood are adjustable and can be tightened or loosened as you wish. You just need to pass them over the buttons several times until you achieve the desired fit. Alternatively, you can cut off the loops altogether if you prefer to have the exact version of the jacket that we presented during the campaign. The loops were added after the campaign as an extra option for those who wanted more flexibility with the hood.
The magnets on the front flap are meant to complement the front zipper, not replace it. They are there to help you close the jacket quickly and easily without having to zip it up every time. However, they are not strong enough to hold the jacket closed by themselves, especially if the jacket is stretched or pulled by your body movements. The jacket material is stretchable and adapts to different body types and sizes, so depending on how you wear it, the magnets might not align perfectly. We recommend using both the zipper and the magnets for optimal closure and comfort.
The zippers on the pockets are the ones that we showed in the campaign and we believe they are suitable for a jacket like this. They are small, discreet and extremely strong. They can withstand a lot of pressure and friction without breaking or jamming. We chose them because we wanted to keep the jacket sleek and minimalist, without compromising on durability.

This is a crowdfunding project and we are constantly learning and improving from your feedback. We will try to keep your suggestions in mind for future versions of our product and we thank you for your understanding and patience.
We also want to let you know that we have offered our backers the best price possible with no profit in mind. Everything goes into the development of future products and we are passionate about creating innovative and functional jackets for you. However, as a very small company, we face some challenges with manufacturing and materials costs that depend on order quantity. For example, some of our manufacturing prices almost doubled from Batch 1 to Batch 2 as the quantities ordered were much smaller. This means that we cannot compete with the discounts that bigger companies get when they order 100x more than us. We hope you can appreciate our efforts and support us in our journey.
We hope this clarifies some of your concerns and helps you enjoy your jacket more. We are proud of our product and we want you to be happy with it too. If you have any other questions or issues, please do not hesitate to contact us again. We value your feedback and we are always here to help.
Thank you again for your support and for being part of our journey.
Sincerely, The Jacket Team"
Sizing Issue,"Hi,

Thank you for your message and your support for our project. We have a register of people that may want to switch sizes, as long as they wrote to us at hello@taftac.com from their registered Kickstarter email address. We do this to ensure that only the real Kickstarter account owner can request size changes. We confirm you are now in that register.

Our jackets are designed to be international and to fit customers from different regions, such as Asia, Europe, and the US. Our jackets are also a slim fit Italian cut that runs no way near the US sizes. Our size M is more like a US size S. But it goes the other way around for Asia where our M is more like an L.

What this means in exchange terms is that for the US we have mostly size up requests and for Asia mostly size down requests so it is very hard to match in the same region. And if a backer ships to another region there will be customs duties and extra shipping costs involved.

We take pride in our craftsmanship and quality, we want you to be satisfied with your Darkheat Jackets, and we would love to help more. But we only produce jackets based on your survey selection, and we don’t have any extra stock in different sizes.

Sadly, the factory demands a minimum order of 500 jackets, and we have less than 30 backers who request an exchange right now out of more than 3000 delivered Jackets. We are looking for other ways to help you get the right fit, but we can’t guarantee anything at this moment.

We hope that you understand our situation and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the size issue. We want you to be happy with your jacket and we will do our best to accommodate your request if possible. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns."
Refund for Executive Extension,"Greetings,

I am delighted to hear from you and I appreciate your interest in our crowdfunding project. You have asked for a refund and I want to explain why this is not a simple matter.

Crowdfunding is a unique way of bringing creative ideas to life with the help of a community. It is not like buying from an online store where you can return the product if you are not satisfied. When you pledge for a project on Kickstarter, you are supporting the creator’s vision and helping them make it a reality. In return, you receive rewards that are exclusive to backers.

As stated in the Kickstarter Refund Policy (https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use#refund-policy), pledges are not usually refundable. Our project follows the same policy, which you can find on our website https://taftac.com/policies/refund-policy.

This is not a policy that we made up, but a common practice among crowdfunding platforms. In fact, even platforms like Pledgebox do not offer a refund option for shipped rewards. This is one of the main reasons we have this policy in place: even if we wanted to refund you, the platform does not allow us to do so.

However, we value your satisfaction and we want you to be happy with our project. That is why we have contacted Pledgebox management and requested a one-time exception just for you. We will let you know when they reply and refund you the full amount if we are successful. Please note that the amount you pledged and the amount that reaches us are quite different. Kickstarter, credit card processors, Pledgebox all take a significant cut. The refund itself also has both a percentage cost and a fixed cost. These costs add up to more than half of the refund amount in the case of the Executive Extension. Normally, these costs are hidden in the product price when it comes to e-commerce. But we wanted to give our backers the best deal possible and did not include any margins for these returns or refunds. With no outside investors and all the money coming from our backers, this means that these costs will ultimately be covered by other backers. This is why we ask you to consider an offer of store credit in twice the amount of the refund. This way, other backers won’t have to bear these costs and you will get some amazing new products. We are working on the V2 version of the DarkHeat™ | Jacket, a new Heated Jacket that can be worn both separately or as a lining to the jacket you already have and the Extreme Comfort Pants we presented to you earlier. Our ultimate goal is for our backers to be happy and we want to make sure we can find a solution that works for everyone.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Kind Regards,

Refund in General,"Greetings,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out in response to your request for a refund on our crowdfunding project. I understand that you may have expectations of a traditional e-commerce experience, however, it's important to note that crowdfunding is a different model so I would like to take a moment to explain why we cannot issue a refund in the traditional sense.

Crowdfunding is not e-commerce and it operates differently from online retail stores. The objective is to provide an opportunity for creative projects to come to life with the support of a community. We rely on the funds raised through pledges to bring our project to life and in exchange, we provide rewards to our backers.

As per the Kickstarter Refund Policy (https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use#refund-policy), pledges made on Kickstarter are not typically refundable. Our project also has a similar policy, which you can find on our website https://taftac.com/policies/refund-policy.

I want to assure you that our goal is for our backers to be happy with their experience on our campaign. Our policy states that we cannot issue refunds for pledges, but we are always open to finding alternative solutions that would make our backers happy.

I would also like to emphasize that this is not just a policy specific to our project, but it is a common practice among crowdfunding platforms. In fact, even with hundreds of thousands of crowdfunding projects, platforms like Pledgebox do not offer a refund option for shipped rewards. This further underscores the fact that crowdfunding is not e-commerce and operates differently from online retail stores with a focus to provide a platform for creative projects to come to life.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Our ultimate goal is for our backers to be happy and we want to make sure we can find a solution that works for everyone.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Size Exchange,"Hi,

You are one of our most valued backers and we appreciate your support for our campaign. We are sorry to hear that the jacket you received from us is not a perfect fit for you. We know how frustrating it can be to get something that does not meet your expectations.

We want you to be happy with your purchase and enjoy wearing our jacket for years to come. That’s why we are offering you two ways to get a replacement jacket that suits you better.

The first way is to send the jacket back to our fulfilment center in China. You can use any courier service you like. As soon as we get it, we will send you a new one in your preferred size. The downside of this option is that you will have to pay for the shipping cost yourself, which might be quite high depending on where you live. It will also take longer for you to receive your new jacket because of the processing and shipping time.

The second way is to keep the jacket you have and get a new one from us at a very low cost. This is a special offer that we are making only to you as a gesture of goodwill and gratitude. We are willing to give you our ThermoDry Pack for men, which includes the Hoodie and Trench Extension in your preferred size with Nano Silver Antimicrobial Coating and Air Shipping. This package is worth more than $300 on our website, but we are giving it to you for only $125. This is the price of the materials used to make the jacket. We are not charging you anything for our labour, time, or expertise. This is the best deal we can offer you because all the funds we have come from our backers like you and we do not have any outside investors. We cannot use other backers’ money to pay for your materials, but we can give you our work and skills for free.

Please let us know which option you prefer by replying to this email. We hope that this offer will make you feel valued and satisfied as our backer. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me anytime.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Kind Regards,

Thermodry and Vest description - Vest upsale,"Hey André,

First off, thanks for backing our project and grabbing a ThermoDry Pack DarkHeat™ | Jacket. You rock!

I’m sorry to hear that you’re not happy with your jacket. Let me explain why it doesn’t have a heating function.

Thermodry is the name of our patent pending fabric that is super awesome. It’s water-resistant, breathable, and durable. Plus, it reflects your body heat back to you, so you stay warm and dry in any weather condition.

The DarkHeat™ 4 Zones Smart Heated Vest is another product that has a heating function with four heating zones and four heating levels that you can adjust with the press of a button. It’s an amazing product that you can wear under the jacket or on its own. We made sure to mention in our campaign page and updates that the jacket and the vest are separate products.

But I get it. You want to feel extra cozy in the winter. That’s why I have a special offer for you.

How about a 50% off coupon for the DarkHeat™ 4 Zones Smart Heated Vest? Sounds good, right?

That means you can get it for only $64.50 instead of current website price $129. That’s a steal!

Just let me know if you want to take advantage of this offer and I’ll send you the coupon code right away. Trust me, you won’t regret it.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Cheers,
The TAFTAC Team"
Epack V2 Offer,"Hi,

You are part of an exclusive group of people who backed our DarkHeat™ | Jacket | Executive Pack on Kickstarter. You have shown great taste and discernment in choosing this product, which is the ultimate pack for the modern adventurer.

We are grateful for your support and patience. We have been working hard to deliver your rewards as soon as possible. However, we have found a problem that presents an amazing opportunity for you and 2 other backers.

As you may recall, we craft our jackets based only on the backers’ survey selection and only include a small extra amount for the jackets that may fail the quality inspection. This ensures that every jacket is made with the highest standards of craftsmanship and materials.

However, after we started production and cut the materials, a lot of backers upgraded to the Executive Pack, which includes the parka extension, the trench extension, and the hoodie. This created a shortage of 3 Executive Packs in size XL Black.

This presents an amazing opportunity for you that will not be available to anyone else.

We are currently working on the V2 version of the DarkHeat™ | Jacket | Executive Pack, which will have some incredible improvements over the original one. Some of the new features include:

Smart heating technology: 4 heating zones with 4 heating levels.
Full lining: A soft and cozy lining that will keep you warm and comfortable in any weather.
Redesigned hood: A better attachment system and improved design.
Improved zippers for more convenience and security.
And many more: We took the feedback from the first 4000 delivered jackets and addressed all issues to make sure that the V2 version is flawless and meets your expectations.

The V2 version will have the same sleek and stylish design as the original one, but with more features and benefits. It will retail at about $50 more than your current pack.

We are giving you the chance to be part of the Batch 0 production of the V2 version, crafted by the best craftsmen from our sample department. You will be among the first people in the world to own this jacket and you will also have the opportunity to contribute to the feedback of the V2 version and new features.

This is a rare and exclusive offer that we are making only to you and 11 other backers who did not receive their order in size XL yet. However, we only have 3 V2 versions available for this offer. Therefore, this offer is valid only for the first 3 backers who reply to this email and confirm their interest.

If you are interested in receiving the V2 version of the DarkHeat™ | Jacket | Executive Pack instead of the original one, please reply to this email by May 1st, 2023 and confirm your interest. If you are among the first 3 backers who reply, we will craft your V2 version and ship it to you by late July - early August 2023. If you are not among the first 3 backers who reply, or if you do not reply at all, we will ship the original V1 version of your rewards by May 5th, 2023.

We hope that you are as excited as we are about the V2 version of the DarkHeat™ | Jacket | Executive Pack. We believe that it will be worth the wait and that you will love it as much as we do.

Thank you again for your support and understanding. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at hello@taftac.com.

Answer to a backer that did not complete his survey yet:,"Hello Terry,

We hope this email finds you well! We have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that we can’t send your shipment without you selecting a jacket size and model and telling us your address.

Customer can't find a hidden pocket or compartment,"Hi,

Backer does not want to pick items up from customs because of high tax or import issues. Return request due to import tax/fees issue.,"Hi,

Thank you for your message and your support. We are sorry to hear that you have some trouble with import tax in your country.

Unfortunately, we cannot accept your request to return the product and ship it to another address. If you do that, we will have to pay:

The import tax that you are not paying
The return shipping cost which is usually twice the amount of the original shipping cost (close to $100 for most locations)
25% import tax in China

This would result in a huge loss for us and we cannot afford it. This is why we always apply for the items to be destroyed locally if they are not picked up by the customers.

Normally, these costs are hidden in the product price when it comes to e-commerce. But we wanted to give our backers the best deal possible and did not include any margins for these returns. With no outside investors and all the money coming from our backers, this means that these costs will ultimately be covered by other backers.

We kindly ask you to pay the import tax and pick up your product as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will not be able to reship it to you and you will lose your reward.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

Kind Regards,
John
